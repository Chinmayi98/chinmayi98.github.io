## DEFINITION
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence
that allows the system to automatically learn and improve from patterns and past data with minimal human intervention

## MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Algorithms in Machine learning are broadly classified into three types
1)	Supervised Learning
2)	Unsupervised Learning
3)	Reinforcement Learning

## 1) Supervised Learning
This algorithm consists of a target variable (dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). It is further classified into two processes.

* Classification: It is the process where present data is labeled based on past data samples

*	Regression: It is the process of identifying patterns and calculating the predictions of continuous outcomes

Some of the most widely used supervised algorithms are Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees,	Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and	Decision Trees.

## 2) Unsupervised Learning
Unlike supervised learning, this algorithm does not have any target variable to predict. It is used for clustering population in different groups and segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.

The most widely used algorithms are t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, Principal Component Analysis and Association rule.

## 3) Reinforcement Learning
In this algorithm, the system uses trail and error method to make decisions.

Most common reinforcement learning algorithms include	Q-Learning,Temporal Difference and Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

## APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
Some of the applications of ML include

* Online product recommendations

* Google self-driving cars

* Fraud detection 

* Spam filtering

* Virtual personal assistants
